From the AboutMe.html, you can run the website.  
I have a few informational files (for me) inside my homework2 folder as my reference.  
You can disregard those.

I probably need help with styling, I meet with a tutor tomorrow and will try
to get those questions answered.

Kind of burnt out right now, brain is kind of full, so may quit here for today.
